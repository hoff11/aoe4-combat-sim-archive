# AoE4 Combat Simulator

## What is this App?

The AoE4 Combat Simulator is an interactive tool for simulating and analyzing combat scenarios in Age of Empires IV. It allows you to build custom armies, configure battle conditions, and visualize the outcome of engagements between different units and civilizations. The simulator is designed for players, theorycrafters, and modders who want to understand the mechanics and balance of AoE4 combat in detail.

## Features

- **Custom Army Builder:** Select units, set their counts, ages, and upgrades for both Team A and Team B.
- **Civilization & Age Selection:** Choose civs and ages to reflect tech and unit availability.
- **Scenario Presets:** Simulate different tactical situations (Engaged, Skirmish, Open Field, Custom) with adjustable starting distance, openness, and kiting rules.
- **Advanced Simulation Engine:** Models ranged/melee combat, opening volleys, auras, kiting, and more using real game data.
- **Detailed Results:** View HP pool graphs, survivor counts, and a breakdown of combat phases (opening volley, contact, etc.).
- **Export/Import:** Share scenarios via URL or JSON, and import others' setups for analysis.
- **Tour & Help:** Built-in guided tour and tooltips for new users.

## Limitations

- **No Real-Time Micro:** The sim assumes basic AI behavior, not pro-level micro or advanced tactics.
- **No Terrain/Obstacles:** All battles are on flat, open ground; no elevation, forests, or walls.
- **No Economy/Production:** Focuses purely on combat, not resource management or build orders.
- **Snapshot Data:** Uses a specific game patch version; may not reflect the latest balance changes.
- **Some Abilities/Techs Simplified:** Not all unique techs or abilities are fully modeled.
- **Tick-Based Resolution:** HP changes and events are processed at discrete intervals, which may cause minor visual offsets in graphs.

## How to Use

1. **Build Your Armies:**
   - Select civ, age, and add units for both teams.
   - Adjust unit counts and apply upgrades/techs as desired.
2. **Configure Scenario:**
   - Choose a preset (Engaged, Skirmish, Open Field) or customize starting distance, openness, and kiting.
3. **Run Simulation:**
   - Click "Run Simulation" to see results. The HP Pool graph shows how each team's health changes over time.
4. **Analyze Results:**
   - Review survivors, damage breakdown, and key combat events (opening volley, contact, etc.).
5. **Export/Import:**
   - Use the menu or buttons to copy a shareable link or export/import JSON for scenarios.
6. **Tour & Help:**
   - Click "Tour" for a guided walkthrough of the interface.

## Tips and Tricks

- **Compare Upgrades:** Try toggling upgrades or techs to see their real impact on combat outcomes.
- **Test Kiting:** Enable kiting in open scenarios to see how ranged units perform with hit-and-run tactics.
- **Use Custom Scenarios:** Adjust starting distance and openness to model different tactical situations.
- **Share with Friends:** Export your scenario as a link or JSON and challenge others to optimize their army.
- **Check Patch Version:** The data version is shown in the header; ensure it matches your in-game patch for best accuracy.
